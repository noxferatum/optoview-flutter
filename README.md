# 👁️ OptoView - Flutter App for Neuro-Optometric Testing

OptoView is a Flutter application designed to perform configurable optometric tests, tailored especially for patients with visual impairments due to brain injuries. It allows clinicians and therapists to select specific test parameters to match the needs of each patient.

## 🧠 Purpose

The main goal of this app is to support neuro-optometric rehabilitation through interactive visual exercises. It is designed to be used in clinical environments and provides flexibility in stimulus configuration.

## 🧪 Features

- Fixed landscape orientation
- Main menu with access to different test modules
- Configurable test parameters:
  - Stimulus side (left / right / both)
  - Symbol type (circle, letter, face, etc.)
  - Speed (slow / medium / fast)
  - Size and duration
- Test modules (starting with "Dynamic Peripheral Perception")
- Smooth animations and optimized visual contrast
