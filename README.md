# 👁️ OptoView - Flutter App for Neuro-Optometric Testing

OptoView is a Flutter application designed to perform configurable optometric tests, tailored especially for patients with visual impairments due to brain injuries. It allows clinicians and therapists to select specific test parameters to match the needs of each patient.
